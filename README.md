- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TyrellClarke
I am a driven individual with strong written and verbal communication skills. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am able to convey information clearly and efficiently. I also have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python.
My strong sense of justice, combined with my technical abilities, fuels my commitment to protecting peopleâ€™s privacy and digital rights. What draws me to cybersecurity is the fieldâ€™s incredible variety â€” work that demands problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity.
